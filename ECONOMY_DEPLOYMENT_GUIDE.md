-- 4. Provide pricing summary
```

### **Step 2: Verify Changes**

After running the SQL, verify the changes:

1. **Check Starting Gold**: New users should start with 50 gold
2. **Check Item Prices**: Items should have new balanced prices
3. **Test Combat Rewards**: Fight and verify new reward system

## üéÆ **New Economy Examples**

- Can buy 1-2 common items (8-25 oro each)
- Needs 1-2 wins to afford basic equipment set
- Creates meaningful choices about what to buy first

### **Experienced Player (Level 5, ~200 oro after 10 wins):**
- Can afford uncommon items (30-50 oro)
- Needs to save for rare items (75-120 oro)
- Creates progression goals

### **Veteran Player (Level 10, ~500 oro after 25 wins):**
- Can afford rare items (75-120 oro)
- Epic items become achievable goals (150-250 oro)
- Legendary items are aspirational (400-800 oro)
